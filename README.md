## Bike-sharing-demand-prediction<br>
Bike sharing system is an evolution of traditional bike rental system which is much more automatic, 
green and customer friendly. Therefore, great interest has been paid into these systems to evaluate
their importance in environmental, health and transportation issues and to predict its future tendency 
and demand.<br>
We study the bike sharing system dataset in a large US city whose duration of travel, departure
and arrival location and weather conditions are recorded explicitly. This feature allows us to explore the nature
of bike sharing demands and its mobility and detect significant events in this particular city.
